Hey there, 

I’m building something different. It’s called the **Knowledge Tree**.

Imagine a massive, expanding library of information - but instead of messy threads and shallow summaries, it’s structured like a living tree. You start with a general topic (like Science, Spirituality, Warfare), then branch out into thousands of specific, curated ideas. Every page is clear, intentional, and built to take you deeper.

No ads. No random edits. No clutter. Just clean, hand-picked knowledge, powered by a mix of AI and human insight.

I’m starting with 30 core branches - the "General Topics" each with its own ecosystem of topics and subgenres. Over time, this will grow into a full exploration of everything we know (and a lot of what we don’t).

The site is read-only - not because I don’t want input, but because I want quality. Curation is the point. Eventually, you’ll be able to explore it visually, zooming through layers of content like you’re navigating the neural network of human thought.

This isn’t for everyone. It’s for the obsessive learners, the ones who go down rabbit holes on purpose. The ones who want to know more than what pops up on page one of search results. The ones who want meaning, structure, and a real journey through ideas.

Right now I’m building the foundation. The tree will go live soon. If this resonates with you — if you’re someone who gets excited by structured knowledge, or you’re curious where this could go - I’d love to hear from you.
